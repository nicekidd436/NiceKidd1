  <h1>welcome in.</h1>
  <p>This website was created just to play around with HTML. But you can access other stuff here as well. the lorax is a secret. youll have to download a file that might be flagged as a virus, but i am not that skilled, it actually a game of sorts... ill let you figure it out. try to convince your friends to open this page too btw.

  <a href="https://unblocked-games.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" target="_blank">Freezenova link</a>

  <p>!!REMEMBER!! Do NOT always trust links on the internet. If someone sends you a random download link: DON'T CLICK IT. If someone insists you sign into a device using THEIR link instead of the actual website, DON'T CLICK. You don't have to sign in to use Freezenova, but still be careful around the internet.</p>
